What is React Parallax?

Have you ever scrolled through a page that felt dynamic? As if you were scrolling through more than one view at once? That’s a parallax effect, and it happens when the different elements of a page move at different speeds — creating a 3D depth effect.

What’s often happening is that the background image will be held in place or move slowly while the images and text on the page scroll normally. You can see it in this project here:
